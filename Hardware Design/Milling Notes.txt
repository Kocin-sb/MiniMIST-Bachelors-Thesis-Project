Printing a PCBSteps:

1. Using Circuit Cam to generate .cam extention to print
 1. Copy the plotted files (.gbr) to the computer.
 2. Import all the files into CircuitCAM application
	(F_CU.gbr,Filetype:GerberX,Layer:TopLayer)
	(Edge_cuts.gbr,Filetype:GerberX,Layer:BorderOutline)
	(B_Silkscreen.gbr,Filetype:GerberX,Layer:SilkScreenBottom)*cancel in our case.
	(B_CU.gbr,Filetype:GerberX,Layer:BottomLayer)
	(B_Silkccreen.gbr,Filetype:GerberX,Layer:SilkScreenTop) *Layer:TopLayer in our case
	(*.drl,FileType:NC-drill,Layer:DrillPlated)
 3.Isolate top and bottom layer using Edit->insulate.
	1. inside jobs select "Bottom" and press Run
	2. Inside jobs select "Top" and press Run
 4. Press Contour Routing Button (next to import button) and press Run without changing any settings
	-This will create a cutting pattern outside of the edge from your board outline
	- Place on the CuttingOutside Layer.
 5. Enter Layers menu and deselect other layers other than CuttingOutside.
 6. On the graphical view, click the end where you need to break breakout tabs and then press the BreakOutTab button. Repeat on the other side.
	- Nesseary to avoid unnesseary moments in of the PCB while milling
 7. Go back to layers to check all unchecked layers that need to be exported.
 8. Export the file, after checking for errors, as *.cam file.

2. Open Board Master applciation to start printing the PCB.
 1. Import the file.
 2. Place the diagram at right place and choose the right board to be printed on.
 3. Once placed properly and make sure the board is taped properly.
 4. Start with drilling.
 5. Milling Front ** Add the pink thing
 6. Milling back
 7. Cutting outside.
